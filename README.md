Vita netcheck Bypass
====================
Add this to your `ux0:tai/config.txt` for any application that requires PSN login to bypass it. Note this only bypasses login and the application might fail elsewhere if it requires PSN functions. It's useful for apps that require PSN but does not use it (Netflix, Remote Play, etc).
